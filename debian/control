Package: owamp-client
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libcap2-bin
Description: OWAMP command line client utilities
 OWAMP is a client/server package that allows one to measure the
 latency between hosts. Unlike ping, which can only measure the
 bidirectional delay, OWAMP enables you to measure the unidirectional
 delay between two hosts.  It is an implementation of the One-Way Active
 Measurement Protocol as defined by RFC4656.
 .
 This package contains command line client utilities for performing
 measurements with an owamp server.
